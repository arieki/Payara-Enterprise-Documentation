=== Security Vulnerability
IMPORTANT:  We recently discovered and fixed an important security vulnerability within the Payara Server and Payara Micro products. A path Traversal security issue was found when the application is deployed under the root context which allowed a hacker to read from the file system of the server running the application. We highly recommend that you upgrade to this version to avoid the security issue.
