Reported security vulnerabilities will get patched as soon as possible and delivered in a future release. If needed, Payara Enterprise customers can make a **request** for specific fixes to be backported to the specific releases they use on their environments.

== Locating Security Vulnerabilities

To locate the release a security update has been included for a specific vulnerability, search in the xref:/security/security-fix-list.adoc[security fixes summary] page for the specific vulnerability using its https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/[CVE identifier].

For each of these security vulnerabilities, a reference to all _*Pull Requests*_ that were implemented to the main repository to fix each one of them is given for auditing purposes. Since the Payara Enterprise repository is private and is not accessible by customers, they may **request** a copy of the details of any specific pull request implemented in the repository for auditing purposes.

[[reporting-security-issues]]
== Reporting Security Issues

Payara Services Limited is very active at identifying and fixing any detected security vulnerabilities, either internally or externally reported. Enterprise customers are encouraged to immediately report any vulnerabilities and flaws that they encounter.

To make a report, make an official **request** through the Customer Support Portal. Please make sure to describe the vulnerability encountered in great detail, along with the steps to reproduce the issue and environment details like the Payara Platform distribution and release version in use, the Operating System where it was detected and its version and the provider and release of the JDK is involved in the reproducer.

NOTE: If the issue relates to an existing documented CVE vulnerability, you can simply link it in your report and save yourself the trouble of providing a reproducer scenario and a detailed description.
