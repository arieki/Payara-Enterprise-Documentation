= Payara Server Upgrade Tool
:page-aliases: upgrade-server.adoc

NOTE: Can be installed manually to Payara Platform 5.20.0 and newer.

This tool can be used to upgrade a Payara Server installation to a newer version. The Upgrade Tool is bundled in Payara Server versions from version *5.24.0*. It can also be obtained from Payara Nexus as the https://nexus.payara.fish/#browse/browse:payara-enterprise:fish%2Fpayara%2Fextras%2Fpayara-upgrade-tool[payara-upgrade-tool artifact] (groupId: `fish.payara.extras`, artifactId: `payara-upgrade-tool`). If obtained from the Payara Nexus, drop the JAR artifact into your Payara Server installation under `payara5/glassfish/lib/asadmin`. The version 1.0 of the standalone upgrade tool can be installed into Payara Server Enterprise 5.20.0 or newer and supports upgrading to any newer Payara Server Enterprise version.

NOTE: This feature is currently released as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and will be gradually getting additional enhancements in future Payara Enterprise releases.

CAUTION: The update tool is not currently supported on Windows yet.

[[upgrade-server-command]]
== Upgrade Server Command

*Usage*::
`asadmin> upgrade-server`

*Aim*::
This command can be used to upgrade Payara Server to the specified distribution along with all SSH nodes in the _domain.xml_.
The command will also back up the old version and domains in the default location (_payara5/glassfish/domains_) to allow for rolling back. The command can also be used to downgrade to an older Payara version although this is not encouraged.

[[rollback-server-command]]
== Rollback Server Command

*Usage*::
`asadmin> rollback-server`

*Aim*::
This command can be used to rollback Payara Server to the point before the upgrade-server command was run. The backup of the domain is not restored automatically. If you need that, you should perform a xref:/documentation/user-guides/restore-domain.adoc[restore-domain command] manually pointing to the ZIP created during the upgrade-server process under `$domaindir/backups` (e.g. `payara5/glassfish/domains/domain1/backups`).
